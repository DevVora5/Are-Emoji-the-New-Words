TATA and the TATA group are always ahead of other companies‚Äîthank you, Vistara, for taking this initiative. I just hope Goibibo doesn‚Äôt take all my money and blame Vistara for not refunding. But that‚Äôs not your concern. Vistara üôè https://t.co/S4YcpdhvML",0.037,0.92,0.043,0.0644,1
"And with that @emirates takes a dig at all other airlines for their pre-flight safety video. Honestly, I do very much love the creativity of the @British_Airways &amp; @airvistara's safety videos.

Flying @airvistara with my mom one last time before it merges into Air India. A truly exceptional Indian brand that redefined luxury in skies. Wishing it could stay forever, but grateful for the experiences‚Äîespecially the J cabin comfort in domestic sectors.
