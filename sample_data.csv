4,Siddartha Khastgir,"And with that @emirates takes a dig at all other airlines for their pre-flight safety video. Honestly, I do very much love the creativity of the @British_Airways &amp; @airvistara's safety videos. They are engaging, fun and do grab your attention... so why not have them? ü§î https://t.co/Ym7FeHcxjQ",Fri Sep 20 20:03:11 +0000 2024,0,4

Flying @airvistara with my mom one last time before it merges into Air India. A truly exceptional Indian brand that redefined luxury in skies. Wishing it could stay forever, but grateful for the experiences‚Äîespecially the J cabin comfort in domestic sectors.
